        <div class="sub">Appearance</div>
        <p>Saturn appears pale yellow to the naked eye. Although never appearing as bright 
        as the other naked eye planets, it is nonetheless obvious when its position is known.
        At its brightest, Saturn outshines all of the stars except Sirius (magnitude -1.46)
        and Canopus (magnitude -0.72). Saturn's famous ring system can be seen in a small 
        telescope at magnifications above ca. 20x; high magnification binoculars will just 
        reveal its elliptical shape when the rings are open to view. </p>

        <div class="sub">Brilliance</div>
        <p>Saturn can be found at a distance of 1.4 billion kilometers (870 million miles)
        from the sun. The planet has no solid surface, so the albedo is completely
        characterized by the gases in its atmosphere, which consists of hydrogen, helium
        and other trace gases. These gases combine to form clouds made from water vapor, 
        ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide clouds. These clouds reflect a significant 
        quantity of incident light, leading to a planetary albedo of 47 percent.</p>

        <div class="sub">Observation</div>
        <p>Once a year Earth goes between the sun and Saturn. 
        This is called an opposition of Saturn, because the planet will appear 
        opposite the sun in our sky, rising in the east as the sun sets in the west.
        This is when the ringed planet is at its closest to Earth and brightest in our sky.
        Saturn's yearly opposition happens about two weeks later with each passing year. 
        The 2016 opposition was on June 3. The 2017 opposition took place on June 15
        and in 2018 it falls on June 27.</p>
