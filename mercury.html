        <div class="sub">Appearance</div>
        <p>Mercury is white in color. But its low altitude causes it to take on a somewhat pinkish hue
        and also makes it twinkle like a star. 
        Mercury is generally more difficult to spot than the other bright planets,
        mainly because, from the vantage point of the Earth, Mercury never appears very
        far from the Sun (between 17 and 28 degrees away, the variation being due to its
        highly eccentric orbit). Consequently it can only be seen with the naked eye when
        it is low down in twilight (shortly after sunset or before sunrise) and it is never
        seen in fully dark skies. </p>

        <p>The planetary albedo of Mercury is 6 percent - one of the lowest in the entire
        solar system. Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, is mainly composed of dark 
        porous rock surface, which reflects very little light. Its atmosphere is very
        faint and consists of 95 percent carbon dioxide, 2.7 percent nitrogen and other
        trace gases. Carbon dioxide is optically transparent and thus does not contribute
        to the planet's albedo. <br>
        Mercury is a less impressive sight also because of its smaller apparent size
        and the much poorer seeing conditions at low altitude.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <div class="sub">Observation</div>
        <p>Mercury is the least observed planet in our entire solar system because of its small
        size and proximity to the sun.
        It typically makes three morning and three evening appearances 
        each year, though for any given location on Earth, Mercury will only be well placed
        for viewing on about half of these occasions. For Northern Hemisphere observers,
        Mercury is best seen on March-April evenings and September-October mornings; 
        Southern Hemisphere observers get their best views on September-October evenings 
        and March-April mornings.</p>
