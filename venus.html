        <p>Venus is by far the easiest planet to see with the naked eye. 
        It shines with a brilliant white light. It is the brightest planet in the night sky.
        When visible, it outshines all the other planets - and indeed all 
        the other stars in the night sky - only the Sun and the Moon are brighter.<br>
        Venus can even be glimpsed in daylight (given a clear, haze-free sky 
        and provided that the planet is well clear of the Sun). 
        The best way to see Venus in daylight is when it is a 'Morning Star', 
        when it can be continually observed through to sunrise and beyond.

        <div class="sub">Brilliance</div>
        <p>Venus' brilliance is largely due to the high reflectivity (albedo) of its clouds.
        It's the planet with the highest albedo in the solar system - 75%.
            The planet's surface is covered by rocky mountains, volcanoes and seas of lava.
        However, it is completely obscured by the dense sulfuric acid clouds
        which reflect the vast majority of sunlight. <br>Another factor contributing to 
        the great brightness of Venus is its proximity to us. Venus comes closer to Earth 
        than any other planet - within 26 million miles (41 million kms).

        <div class="sub">Observation</div>
        <p>An apparition of an object is a period of time during which
        it is visible in the night sky. Venus has a cycle of alternating morning and 
        evening appearances, and is therefore respectively named The Morning or The Evening Star.  
        Each apparition lasts for several months, during which time the planet 
        moves away from the Sun, reaches its greatest elongation and then moves
        back towards the Sun.
        Its greatest brilliance occurs about 5 weeks after greatest Eastern elongation 
        and about 5 weeks before greatest Western elongation.
