        <p>Venus is by far the easiest planet to see with the naked eye. 
        It shines with a brilliant white light. It is the brightest planet in the night sky.
        When visible, it outshines all the other planets - and indeed all 
        the other stars in the night sky - only the Sun and the Moon are brighter.<br>
        Venus can even be glimpsed in daylight (given a clear, haze-free sky 
        and provided that the planet is well clear of the Sun). 
        The best way to see Venus in daylight is when it is a 'Morning Star', 
        when it can be continually observed through to sunrise and beyond.

        <div class="sub">Brilliance</div>
        <p>Venus' brilliance is largely due to the high reflectivity (albedo) of its clouds.
        Venus is the planet with the highest albedo in the solar system, with a value of 75%.
            The planet's surface is covered by rocky mountains, volcanoes and seas of lava.
        However, it is completely obscured by the dense atmospheric clouds 
        that blanket the planet. The atmospheric clouds primarily consist of sulfuric acid,
        which reflect the vast majority of sunlight. <br>Another factor contributing to 
        the great brightness of Venus is its proximity to us. Venus comes closer to the Earth 
        than any other planet - to within 26 million miles (41 million kms).

        <div class="sub">Visibility</div>
        <p>An apparition of an object is a period of weeks or months during which
        it is visible in the night sky. Venus has a cycle of alternating morning and 
        evening appearances , and is thus respectively named The Morning Star and The Evening Star.  
        Each apparition lasts for several months, during which time the planet slowly 
        moves away from the Sun, reaches its greatest elongation and then slowly moves
        back towards the Sun, eventually disappearing into the morning or evening twilight.
        Its greatest brilliance occurs about 5 weeks after greatest Eastern elongation
        (evening apparition) and about 5 weeks before greatest Western elongation (morning apparition).
