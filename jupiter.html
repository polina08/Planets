        <p>Jupiter appears bright white and is a very obvious sight in the night sky. 
        Like Venus, it can be seen in twilight, and it always shines brighter than the 
        brightest star in the night sky - Sirius (magnitude -1.46). Depending on Jupiter's 
        position with respect to the Earth, it can vary in 
        visual magnitude from as bright as -2.9 at opposition down to -1.6 during 
        conjunction with the Sun. Viewed from the Earth, 
        Jupiter is seen to move through about one zodiac constellation (ca. 30 degrees) 
        each year.</p>

        <p>Jupiter's albedo is 52% which is the second highest of all the planets. Jupiter's 
        atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the 
        remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. The outermost 
        layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia which are highly 
        reflective.<br> Jupiter is the largest of all the planets and relatively
        close to the Sun - which makes it the fourth brightest object in the sky 
        after the Sun, Moon, and Venus.

        <div class="sub">Observation</div>
        <p>Jupiter has long visibility period - about 360 days in each one of the apparitions
        that last for 398 days. Jupiter reaches maximum brilliance during opposition. As viewed 
        from Earth, Jupiter lies directly opposite the Sun. It rises at sunset, sets at sunrise, 
        and is visible in the sky all night. Opposition is also the point when the planet lies
        closest to Earth, so Jupiter shines brightest and appears largest. At this time Jupiter 
        is at its highest point - we view it through the least amount of Earthâ€™s atmosphere. </p>
