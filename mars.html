        <div class="sub">Appearance</div>
        <p>Mars is easily recognised since it has the most distinctive coloration of all 
        the naked eye planets. Although it is popularly called 'The Red Planet', it rarely 
        appears red to the naked eye; in fact, it varies from pale orange-yellow to 
        orange-red, depending upon its distance from the Earth and therefore, its brightness.
        The reddish color is caused by the presence of iron oxide (rust) on the planet's 
        surface. Occasional global dust storms on Mars, as those in 
        2001 and 2007, can make it appear decidedly yellowish.</p>

        <div class="sub">Brilliance</div>
        <p>The surface of Mars consists mainly of red soil. Because the atmosphere 
        of Mars is very thin, its albedo, at 29 percent, is 
        dominated by the relatively dark surface. <br>Because of its eccentric orbit, 
        Mars' distance from the Earth varies considerably from one opposition to the next.
        At its brightest, Mars outshines the star Sirius. When it is on the far side of its 
        orbit from the Earth, Mars appears as an unremarkable, orange-red 'star', 
        shining only about as bright as the stars of Orion's Belt.</p>

        <div class="sub">Observation</div>
        <p>Mars is best viewed near its opposition when it appears the brightest. This means that the planet 
        will be directly opposite the sun in our sky. The planet only reaches opposition
        once every 780 days on average.
        At this point in its orbit, Mars rises in the east as the Sun sets, making it 
        visible all night. Some oppositions are more favorable than others
        because Mars lies closer to the Sun (and therefore to Earth). The point of 
        closest approach between Mars and Earth occurs eight days after opposition.</p>
